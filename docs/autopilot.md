# Autopilot

Instructions and memory for the scheduled Claude Code runs that work on Decoded without a person watching. Each run starts in a fresh session with no memory of earlier runs, so **this file is the memory**. Read it first and update it last.

Owner: Ahmed Alghali ([a7med7x7](https://github.com/a7med7x7)). Edit this file to steer the runs: reorder the queues, add tasks, or change the rules below.

## Schedule

Times are Qatar time (UTC+3).

| Run | Time | Job |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | 06:10 | **Exam work:** the next phase in the exam queue |
| B | 10:40 | **Exam work:** the next phase in the exam queue |
| C | 14:50 | **Quality work:** the top item in the quality queue |

If the job's queue is empty, take the top item in the other queue. If both are empty, log that and stop.

## Merge policy

- **2026-11-02 (day 1):** the run merges its own pull request once CI passes.
- **From 2026-11-03:** open the pull request and leave it for the owner to review and merge. Don't merge.
- **Exam phases stack.** If the previous phase's PR isn't merged yet, branch from its branch and open the new PR against it, saying so in the PR description, so the owner can review them in order.
- Never push straight to `main`. Never force-push a branch someone else has pushed to.

## Rules for every run

1. **One task per run.** Finish it, ship it, stop. Don't start a second task to fill time.
2. **Stop rule.** If the task is unclear, or tests still fail after two real attempts at a fix, stop. Commit any useful work to the branch, log what blocked you under "Blocked", and end the run.
3. **Follow the repo's own rules:** `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/building-a-course.md` (including "Linking between lessons") and `docs/brand.md`.
4. **Before opening or updating a pull request:** `npm run lint` (0 errors), `npm run test` and `npm run build` all pass.
5. **Facts must be right.** Work every example again and run every code sample. No source material is provided, so write from standard textbooks and recognized curricula (ACM/IEEE CS2023) in your own words.
6. **GitHub:** `gh pr ...` and `gh issue ...` fail in these sessions (GraphQL is blocked). Use the REST API through `gh api`, for example:
   - open: `gh api repos/STACK-42/decoded/pulls -f title=... -f head=<branch> -f base=main -f body=... -F draft=true`
   - merge: `gh api -X PUT repos/STACK-42/decoded/pulls/<n>/merge -f merge_method=merge`
   - CI: `gh api repos/STACK-42/decoded/commits/<sha>/check-runs`
   If CI fails in the "Setup Bun" step with a 403, that's issue #37 (fixed by PR #51 once merged) and not your code. Re-run the job once.
7. **Branches:** `autopilot/exams-<phase-number>-<short-name>` for an exam phase, and `autopilot/<short-task-name>` for anything else.
8. **Finish by updating this file** on your branch: tick off what you did, add anything new you noticed to the quality queue, and add a line to the run log.

## Exam queue

The owner's priority since 2026-11-03: proper exam practice. The design, decisions and phases are in [`docs/exams.md`](exams.md); follow it, and update it if a phase teaches you something that changes the plan. One phase per run.

- [ ] 1. Question bank: move the 259 quiz questions into per-course `questions.ts`, quizzes read from it, no visible change.
- [ ] 2. Course exam page at `/courses/<course>/exam`.
- [ ] 3. Review queue (Leitner) at `/review`, with "N due" on the Dashboard.
- [ ] 4. Question banks for Operating Systems and Advanced Algorithms, then at least 4 questions per taught lesson everywhere.
- [ ] 5. Generated questions (subnets, scheduling, Big-O first).
- [ ] 6. Account sync for review cards and exam attempts.

## Parked

- **New courses** are on hold until the exam work is done.
- **Distributed Systems:** modules 1 and 2 (9 lessons) are complete on branch `autopilot/course-distributed-systems`; PR #49 is closed, not merged. The plan for modules 3 and 4 is in `docs/autopilot.md` on that branch. Reopen #49 to continue or to ship the two finished modules.

## Quality queue

Linking, broken visualizations, and rework of anything that isn't good enough. Top item first.

1. ~~**Issue #42, linking: Algorithm Design and Analysis ↔ Advanced Algorithms.** Five topics are taught in both with zero links between them. Link each pair both ways (pairs are listed in the issue).~~ Done before this queue was written; checked 2026-11-02: both directions linked, and every non-quiz lesson in these courses has links.
2. ~~**Issue #42, linking: Operating Systems ↔ Computer Architecture and Computer Organization** (virtual memory, paging, memory hierarchy).~~ Done before this queue was written; checked 2026-11-02: both directions linked, and every non-quiz lesson in these courses has links.
3. ~~**Issue #42, linking: Theory of Computation.** Zero links out across 14 lessons.~~ Done before this queue was written; checked 2026-11-02: 65 links out, in every lesson except the two quizzes.
4. ~~**Issue #42, linking: Operating Systems.** Zero links out across 17 lessons.~~ Done before this queue was written; checked 2026-11-02: 72 links out, in all 17 lessons.
5. ~~**Issue #38:** README course table.~~ Done 2026-11-02 (run C): Operating Systems row added, Advanced Algorithms count fixed (24, not 25); every other row matches `registry.ts`.
6. **Visualizer audit.** Open every visualizer at phone width in light and dark themes (Playwright is installed) and log anything broken, cramped or confusing as its own item here. Fix the worst one in the same run.
7. ~~**Issue #37:** pin the Bun version.~~ PR #51 (pinned to 1.4.4), waiting for review.
8. **Issue #42, the rest:** Advanced Algorithms, Algorithm Design and Analysis, Computer Literacy, The Exam Mind, then the generic-preview fixes (bold definitions) in the courses marked "previews only".

## Blocked

Nothing yet.

## Run log

Newest first. One line per run: date and run, what was done, PR link, merged or open.

- 2026-11-03 (owner request): new direction. Distributed Systems parked (#49 closed, branch kept; M2 had been added by run A that morning). Bun pinned (#51, open). Exam plan written in `docs/exams.md` and queued here (#52, open). Runs A and B switched from course work to exam work.
- 2026-11-02 14:50 (run C): quality items 1-4 were already done on main (issue #42's checklist is stale), so took item 5: README course table (#38). PR #50, merged.
- 2026-11-02 01:10 (setup): wrote this file. Baseline: 2,104 tests pass, lint 0 errors, CI green on `main` (82faa87).
